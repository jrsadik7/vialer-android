Yes, we did it, a complete redesign of the app!

Improvements:
- New interface and icon
- Preparations for calling over your internet connection
- Availability is visible and can be changed in the app
- The stats page is more mobile friendly now
- During calling, the status of the call is shown on the screen

Bugfixes:
- The recents contains more information on who called and if the call was incoming or not
- Picking a number from recents or contacts will immediately setup a call with the app
